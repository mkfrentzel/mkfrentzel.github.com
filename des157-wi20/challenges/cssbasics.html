            <h2>Inheritance in CSS</h2>
            <p>Generally, inheritance in CSS refers to the properties of an element that get stylized and passed down. It helps create a standardized design across the page while only needing to specify the style once. An example of an inherited property is color, meaning that if you assign all of the paragraph elements to be one color, then all elements within the paragraph property will be that same color. An example of something that would not take on that inherrited element would be if you added a link to your text. Because you would be adding that within it's own tag that has it's own specified default styling.</p>

            <h2>Specificity in CSS</h2>
            <p>Specificity in CSS allows you to narrow down which style properties will be applied to which elements across your code. It is given more priority than inherited elements, and the code will always follow the last rule specified in your code if there are competing directions. Multiple selectors focus on creating specific rules for separate elements and stylizing them individually, whereas compound selectors go a step further and increase specificity even more by targeting unique elements within a group.</p>

            <h2>ID and Class Attributes</h2>
            <p>Classes and ID's are selector attributes tht allow you to target the elements on your page. The ID attribute can only be used once on each page, whereas the class attribute can be used across multiple elements and in multiple places on your page.</p>
