                        <h3>Informing users of fake news & the potential to slow its dissemination:</h3>
                        <h4>Background of fake news:</h4>

                            <p>In the article, The science of fake news, David Lazer and fellow authors discuss all aspects of fake news across multiple disciplines. The authors recognize a distinguishing factor of fake news is “the intent and processes of the publisher.” While this is one definition that these authors chose to use for fake news, there is a plethora of alternative definitions that have been used to define fake news. This is something I plan to explore in my interaction design project and will hopefully be able to communicate the general thoughts about what fake news really is, and how people can avoid a false sense of security in the media. The Library Technology Reports examines the historical aspects of fake news and reminds readers that the phenomena is not a new trend in our history. As stated in their research and writings, fake news ages back to the creation of language - even before the media was a known subject, fake news existed. This article places the origin of fake news back to the days of clay tablets and cuneiform, which is something I imagine most people aren’t aware of. I hope I can bring this information to light in my interactive project and encourage users to critically think about the history of media in order to inform them of its future.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Dissemination (according to current standards):</h4>
                            
                            <p>More fake news is disseminated on Twitter, most likely because users are less inclined to fact check before hitting retweet. Living in an age of social media and a wider platform to view, create, and share media has opened many doors for accessibility to media; however, the ease at which the public is able to participate and enact these rights has also brought into question the accuracy of the information being shared. For example, anyone is able to hit tweet and share a post or article, and furthermore, the public is also able to simply ‘retweet’ that information at the click of a button. There are no qualifications or standards being upheld on these social media platforms, and therefore, there are no guarantees that the information being shared has any accuracy at all. It was actually found in one study, that false information was dispersed more quickly on Twitter than any accurate information was in the topic of politics.</p>
                            
                            <p>This article talks in depth about the number of automated bots that are responsible for sharing much of the false information on these social media platforms. The article cites “nine to fifteen percent of active Twitter accounts are bots,” which have the ability to disseminate information at much faster rates than the average user. However, the article acknowledges that “bot detection will always be a cat-and-mouse game in which a large, but unknown, number of humanlike bots may go undetected” which adds another layer of difficulty to understanding the true impacts of their presence. The writers of this article make an important point in distinguishing users who come in contact with fake news from those who are actually affected by fake news - something that is very difficult to measure in short-term studies.</p>
                            
                            <p>Research by Soroush Vosoughi, Deb Roy, and Sinan Aral in their article The Spread of true and false news online provides an in-depth analysis of how news actually travels, whether it is fake or not. The functionality behind fake news and how it physically spreads is a vital aspect to understanding the issue and how to prevent further dissemination of fake news in the future. I hope to use the information from this article to implement statistics and educational content for the users of my interactive platform to further develop their discernment skills. I also hope it will be empowering for them to be educated and understand how exactly the news they see is delivered to them, in terms of accuracy measures.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Potential interventions on an individual level and structural level (algorithms):</h4>
                            
                            <p>There is power in the hands of every individual to limit the spread of fake news, so long as the public chooses to be aware and conscious. The article discusses multiple platforms that are able to help evaluate and validify news reports such asPolitiFact and Snopes, or simply being more in tune to what has been established as credible media outlets such as the Washington Post or Wall Street Journal. However, people do not make the effort to critically analyze their sources or information, especially when it does not visibly alarm them or go against their immediate beliefs. The confirmation bias is a well-known theory that people let their guards down significantly more when it is information they believe falls in line with their thoughts or values. I hope to make this bias known to the users of my interactive website and help develop critical thinking skills when it comes to all media forms.</p>
