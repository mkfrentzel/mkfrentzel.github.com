                        <h2>Example Persona 1</h2>
                        <p>One user of my program who might be engaging with my program are those very actively involved in politics. This user might already have a strong knowledge of current and past political affairs and might be more speculative of the information on my website to check for accuracy. They will most likely be using the interactive features heavily to thoroughly read all of the information on my page.</p>

                        <div class="column" id="personaTwo">
                        <h2>Example Persona 2</h2>
                        <p>A second potential user of my website is someone who has some political background or knowledge, but is seeking more education about the topic. They are probably someone who has heard a lot of the fake news buzzwords in recent political agendas and media portrayals, but are less informed about past historical aspects of this topic. They are likely someone who will interact with the portions of the page they find most interesting, and might be less critical or thorough than Persona 1.</p>

                        <div class="column" id="personaThree">
                            <h2>Example Persona 3</h2>
                            <p>Another potential user for my website would be those who are completely out of the political loop so to speak. Users who have little to no background and are hoping to get a quick crash course in some politcs before the election. They will probably engage heavily with the platform to learn as much as possible, but will be far less critical than the first persona. They will also probably have a harder time maintaining interest, so the design of information and interactivity will have to be more engaging for these users in order to hold their attention.</p>
